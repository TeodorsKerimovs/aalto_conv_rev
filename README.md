Teodors, Vaibhav and Håvard participated in Neural DSP course on Real Time Audio Programming in August 2023. We created convolution reverb in Juce with help of Neural DSP templates. We have upright piano impulse responses recorded and added. Special thanks to course teacher - João Rossi.

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Run the 'aalto_conv_rev.jucer' file found in projects/aalto_conv_rev. You need to have a Projucer build in order to perform this step.
2. Select 'Save and Open in IDE' from the Projucer UI and build the solution.
3. After the build succeeds, you will find the .vst3 file in \Builds\VisualStudio2022\x64\Release\VST3
