Teodors, Vaibhav and Håvard participated in Neural DSP course on Real Time Audio Programming held at Aalto University held between 28th August - 01st September, 2023. We created a Convolution Reverb in JUCE with the help of Neural DSP templates. Upright piano impulse responses were recorded and are added in the repo under final_stereo_IRs. Special thanks to course teacher - João Rossi.

INSTRUCTIONS

1. Run the 'aalto_conv_rev.jucer' file found in projects/aalto_conv_rev. You need to have a Projucer build in order to perform this step.
2. Select 'Save and Open in IDE' from the Projucer UI and build the solution.
3. After the build succeeds, you will find the .vst3 file in \Builds\VisualStudio2022\x64\Release\VST3

NOTE - The 'dsp' and 'modules' folders were provided by NeuralDSP as a part of the course and can be found on their repo https://github.com/Neural-DSP/modern-rt-audio-course. For our purpose, we mainly edited the RingMod file found in the 'dsp' folder.
